/**
  * Class FileServerConnection is used for handling file read requests from
  * remote clients. One instance of the class serves one file from one client
  * at a time.
  *
  * Objects of this class are inistantiated by FileServer. After that
  * the server calls this class's method beginProtocol() which starts
  * a series of asynchronous operations to communicate with remote client.
  * When all details of an incoming request are obtained from the client
  * the connection object begins actual processing of the request and
  * communicates with a client as required by the file transfer protocol.
  * All communications are asynchronous using Google protobuf.
  *
  * The lifespan of this object is exactly one request until it's fully
  * satisfied or any failure during request execution (when reading a file,
  * or communicating with a client) occures. When this happens the object
  * stops doing anything.
  *
  * This is essentially an RPC protocol which runs in a loop this sequence of steps
  * starting with a call to beginProtocol().
  *   - ASYNC: read a frame header of a request
  *   - SYNC:  read the request header (a specification of a file, etc.)
  *   - ASYNC: write a frame header of a reply to the request
  *            followed by a status (to tell a client if the specified file
  *            is available or not, and if so then what would be its size, etc.)
  *   - ASYNC: if the request is accepted then begin streaming the content of
  *            a file in a series of records until it's done.
  *
  * NOTES: A reason why the read phase is split into three steps is
  *        that a client is expected to send all components of the request
  *        (frame header and request header) at once. This means
  *        the whole incomming message will be already available on the server's
  *        host memory when an asyncronous handler for the frame header will fire.
  *        However, due to a variable length of the request we should know its length
  *        before attempting to read the rest of the incomming message as this (the later)
  *        will require two things: 1) to ensure we have enough buffer space
  *        allocated, and 2) to tell the asynchrnous reader function
  *        how many bytes exactly are we going to read.
  *
  * The chain ends when a client disconnects or when an error condition
  * is met.
  *
