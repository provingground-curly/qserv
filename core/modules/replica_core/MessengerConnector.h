 * This class provides a communication interface for sending/receiving messages

 * reconnects.
 *
 * NOTES ON THREAD SAFETY:
 * 
 * - in the implementation of this class a mutex is used to prevent race conditions
 *   when performing internal state transitions.
 *   
 * - to avoid deadlocks, only externally called methods of the public API (such
 *   as the ones for sending or cancelling requests) and assynchronious callbacks
 *   are locking on the mutex. Those methods are NOT allowed to call each other.
 *   Otherwise deadlocks are imminent.
 *   
 * - other implementatin-specific methods are supposed to be invoked from either
 *   of the above mentioned methods.
